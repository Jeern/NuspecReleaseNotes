NugetReleaseNotes is just a simple WinForm application that recursively 
finds all Nuspec files in the current Directory. Loads the release notes and makes 
it easy to edit them. Either for all files or for each one. 

## Usage

If as an example you have several nuspec files in 
your Visual Studio solution and want to edit your release notes before you 
create and deploy your nuget packages. You just place NuspecReleaseNotes.exe in the root folder
of your solution and run it.

## Warning

If you place the NuspecReleaseNotes in the root of your harddrive it will load all Nuspec 
files on your entire harddrive. This is probably not what you want !
